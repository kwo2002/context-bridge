```json
{
  "title": "Replace payment retry logic with Exponential Backoff",
  "intent": "**Problem**: The existing Fixed Retry approach caused simultaneous retries to pile up during server overload, worsening outages.\n\n**Solution**: Applied Exponential Backoff + Jitter to distribute retry requests and secure server recovery time.\n\n**Effect**: Prevents simultaneous retry storms and ensures server recovery time.",
  "alternatives": "**Alternative 1 — Increase Fixed Retry interval**\n- Approach: Keep existing logic but increase interval to reduce load\n- Rejected because: Simultaneous requests could still pile up depending on traffic patterns.",
  "diffSummary": "- **PaymentRetryService.kt**: Replaced retry logic from FixedDelay to ExponentialBackoff.\n- **application.yml**: Added 3 retry-related settings (maxAttempts, initialInterval, multiplier).",
  "commitHash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
